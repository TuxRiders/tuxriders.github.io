The [TuxRiders YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TuxRiders) started to work with free education and open-source philosophy in mind. In line with this outlook, the content we publish will never get monetized for personal profit. At this moment, all the ads you may see while watching our videos are displayed by YouTube without having any profit for us. If we decide to monetize the channel at some point, all the earned profit will be donated to relevant ongoing open-source software projects (with full reports being announced on this page).
