This is the list of content we intended to record/release eventually, although it doesn't mean that more projects/content will not be added to this list. You can find a link to already published content here, about which more information is provided on the [Video Series page](../videos).

### Introductory Series

* [Postprocessing simulation results using ParaView](../videos/postprocessing)

* [Setup your scientific computing environment](../videos/setup)

* [An easy (but not so short) introduction to applied numerical computing (numerical methods for solving partial differential equations)](../videos/numerical-computing)

* Introduction to finite element programming using FreeFEM and FEniCS

* Introduction to mesh generation using GMSH, SALOME, CGAL, and Mmg

* A crash course on high-performance computing and parallel programming 

### Research Projects Series

* Mass transfer in tissue engineering: cell viability assessment of pancreatic islets for diabetes treatment 

* Demystify a PhD project: simulation of corrosion and biodegradation behavior of medical implants

* Machine learning for mechanistic modeling: Physics-informed neural network modeling of mass transfer in biomedical engineering
