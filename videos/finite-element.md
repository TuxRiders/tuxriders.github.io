title: An introduction to finite element modeling
---

In this series, we simulate a single problem in different finite element programs.

## Series Materials

In order to follow the videos and reproduce the output, you may want to use the ready codes and models instead of creating them from scratch using the instructions from previous videos. You can find all the relevant stuff, grouped for different episodes in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/TuxRiders/finite-element-intro)
