title: Introduction to finite element using FreeFEM
---

FreeFEM is one of the tools we use a lot in TuxRiders, a powerful open-source PDE solver which is actually a domain-specific language (DSL) for finite element computation. It also includes nice interfaces to a wide variety of scientific computing libraries and tools. In this series, we cover the FreeFEM basic concepts.
