title: Mini-projects in FreeFEM
---

After covering the basic concepts, terminologies, and techniques of the [FreeFEM language](/videos/freefem) and the finite element method ([here](/videos/finite-element) and [here](/videos/numerical-computing)), it's time to showcase some models as mini-projects in FreeFEM, helping you to see the things you learned in action.

## Source Codes

Codes and models required to follow the videos and reproduce the output, grouped per episode, can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/TuxRiders/freefem-mini-projects).
