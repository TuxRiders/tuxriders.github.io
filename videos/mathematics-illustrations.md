title: Engineering mathematics and simulation illustrations
---

In this series, the essential concepts of partial differential equations and numerical modeling are demonstrated in animated illustrations.

## Source Codes

Some of these videos are created using [Manim community edition](https://www.manim.community/) and Python, the source code of which can be found in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/TuxRiders/mathematics-illustrations).
