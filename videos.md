### [Postprocessing simulation results using ParaView](postprocessing)

Post-processing is usually the last (but definitely not least) step of a scientific computing project. In this series, you will see some examples of employing ParaView for analyzing and post-processing the results of various types of computational simulations. [See more...](postprocessing)


### [Setup your scientific computing environment](setup)

Environment setup is one of the most fundamental topics we want to talk about. In this series, we will setup a Linux environment for scientific computing from scratch and discuss its various aspects. Beside the techniques you will see for installing, compiling, and building a wide range of programs we need later, it may provide an opportunity to know those programs if you don’t.  [See more...](setup)

### [An easy introduction to applied numerical computing](numerical-computing)

Numerical computing is the foundation of all the things we are going to discuss. Solving complex mathematical equations (more specifically, differential equations, describing a wide range of phenomena in science and engineering) requires special techniques called numerical methods. It’s called like this to show that the equations cannot be solved directly (or let’s say analytically). This is the foundation of most of computer modeling and simulation works, so we need to get familiar with the concepts of numerical methods (numerical computing). [See more...](numerical-computing)

### [On-demand videos](on-demand)

This video series aims to cover interesting topics that cannot be put it in the syllabus of the [scheduled series](../content). We try to collect interesting questions/comments/challenges and make elaborated videos on them. To enrich this, don't hesitate to reach out for asking your questions or telling us your suggestions. Watch the first video to find out more details. [See more...](on-demand)

### [An introduction to finite element modeling](finite-element)

The idea behind this series is to simulate a single problem in different finite element programs and see the principles they all have in common. The problem to solve is selected to be a little bit more complex than the typical problems you see in tutorials: a transient heat transfer in a helical heat exchanger. We are going to build a 3D geometry in a CAD program, generate a mesh out of it, import the mesh into multiple finite element solvers, and solve a transient heat diffusion equation on it. This demonstrates a typical workflow of any finite element modeling project when a not-so-simple geometry is required. [See more...](finite-element)
